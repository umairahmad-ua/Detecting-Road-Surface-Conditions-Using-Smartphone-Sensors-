Detecting Road Surface Conditions Using Smartphone Sensors  Accelerometer sensor when reading augmented with Gyro sensor data has a better chance of detecting the road condition. 2) Which accelerometer readings better explain the road conditions. 3) Experimental data is showing mostly bad road conditions at high speed. Verify this claim. 4) Time of the recording is closely correlated with the road condition. 5) From all the given sensor values pick the best 5 that you think predict the road condition the best.
