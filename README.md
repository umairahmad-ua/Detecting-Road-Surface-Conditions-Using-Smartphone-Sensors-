# Detecting-Road-Surface-Conditions-Using-Smartphone-Sensors-
We breaked our analysis into descriptive statistics to construct the answer. Road detection is of important part for the traveling comfort and driving safety. The data collected by smartphone sensors to detect road conditions in real-time.

* Global Positioning System (GPS)

* Accelerometer (x, y, z-axis values)

* Gyroscope (x, y, z-axis values)

* Overall travel distance can be obtained using GPS sensor.

* Accelerometers in smartphones are used to detect the orientation of the phone (vertical displacement).

* The gyroscope adds an additional dimension to the information supplied by the accelerometer by tracking rotation or twist.

## Question 1: 

Accelerometer sensor when reading augmented with Gyro sensor data has a better chance of detecting the road condition.?

## Question 2: 

Which accelerometer readings better explain the road conditions?

## Question 3: 

Experimental data is showing mostly bad road conditions at high speed. Verify this claim?

## Question 4. 

Time of the recording is closely correlated with the road condition?

## Question 5:

From all the given sensor values pick the best 5 that you think predict the road condition the best?
