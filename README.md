# Detecting-Road-Surface-Conditions-Using-Smartphone-Sensors-
* Accelerometer sensor when reading augmented with Gyro sensor data has a better chance of detecting the road condition.
* Which accelerometer readings better explain the road conditions. 
* Experimental data is showing mostly bad road conditions at high speed. Verify this claim. 
* Time of the recording is closely correlated with the road condition. 
* From all the given sensor values pick the best 5 that you think predict the road condition the best.
